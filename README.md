# 3-D Graphics Engine

The purpose of this project is to create a software application capable of loading and modeling 3D graphics. 
3D coordinates are converted into 2D coordinates using a projection matrix. Textures are then generated and 
bound using the projection matrix.

Libraries:<br/>
  OpenGL 3.3 - to create models and texture objects.<br/>
  GLAD (OpenGL Loading Library) - to simplify the process of loading OpenGL functions.<br/>
  GLFW - to create and manage windows and OpenGL contexts, as well as handle joystick, keyboard and mouse input.<br/>
  OpenGL Mathematics (GLM) - for vector and matrix mathematics.
